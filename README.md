This is a template for doing Advent Of Code in XCode (using Swift).

There are fifty different targets, one for each puzzle. The expected workflow is:
- set target to Day X, Part 1
- copy input from browser and paste input into existing `Day X/input` file
- solve Part 1 in existing `Day X/part 1.swift` file
- copy contents of `Day X/part 1.swift` and paste into existing `Day X/part 2.swift` file
- change target to Day X, Part 2
- solve Part 2 in `Day X/part 2.swift` file

Good luck!
